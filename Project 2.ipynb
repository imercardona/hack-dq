    "# Analysing 'Ask' vs 'Show' Posts in relation to user interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to work with a data set of submissions posted on popular technology website Hacker Newss. \n",
    "This website is a site hosted by startup incubator Y Combinator where users submit their own 'posts' which other readers can vote and comment upon. Another website similar to this is Reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles and posts that are well voted and commented end up having hundreds of thousands of visits as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is available online and can be found and downloaded here. This is a reduced version of the original dataset which actually contains almost 300k rows. Our dataset contains of approximately 20k rows as posts that did not receive any comments were removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in 'Ask Posts', which are posts where the user specifically looks for feedback by asking a question like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to get more followers on Instagram?\n",
    "* How to use Chrome's Developer Tools?\n",
    "* How to make a website responsive?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, 'Show Posts' are posts where the user specifically wants to showcase something to the community which the latter will provide feedback on. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look at this programming language I created\n",
    "* This is how I'm spending my Covid-19 quarantine\n",
    "* I created a sports predicting model for football\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this project we'll be coming up with conclusions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which posts receive more comments on average? Ask Posts or Show Posts?\n",
    "* Does time of upload have any effect on the feedback a post receives?"
